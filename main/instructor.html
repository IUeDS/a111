       <p>Hi, I'm Michael Stucker, the coordinator for the electronics courses at the I.U. Jacobs School of Music and likely your instructor for this course. I'm not particularly fond of talking about myself but I think it is important for you to know something about your instructor, so I asked a recent graduate to write a little about me.</p>
       
       <p>Dan Talton is a 2014 graduate of the I.U. Jacobs School of Music Department of Recording Arts and was a member of the Hutton Honors College while at IU.</p>
       
       <div class="basicconcept">
            	<div class="basicconcept_header">from former student Dan Talton</div>
                <div class="basicconcept_body" style="text-align: left">
                    <p>&quot;Michael Stucker is as invested in his students as any professor I have had the pleasure of interacting with.  His experience in the field of audio and audio electronics is remarkable, and his knowledge staggering.  Never one to spoon-feed a curriculum, Professor Stucker expects much from his students. That said, for every ounce of effort a student puts forth, he or she will receive a pound in return.</p>  
                    <p>Michael Stucker&rsquo;s classes are a perfect platform for establishing a firm, carefully-built foundation of knowledge and practical experience.  To get the most from his classes, students should expect to find ways to go above and beyond the curriculumâ€”personal projects, pointed questions, and extracurricular research.  Professor Stucker is an invaluable resource, a near-inexhaustible source of advice, knowledge, and experience to draw from that students would do well to take advantage of.</p>
                   <p>In class, Professor Stucker is relaxed, but demanding.  Every student should expect to make many mistakes, to be asked to solve difficult problems, and to be pushed a bit outside of his or her comfort zone.  This environment serves to encourage the students to pursue the knowledge they lack, and to be confident in the knowledge they possess.</p>
                   <p>As a person, Stucker is friendly and conversational--just as happy to hear a joke or story, preferably sarcastic, as he is to share one.  Above all, Michael Stucker is truly, sincerely interested in his students&rsquo; development as audio engineers.  If you are likewise interested in your own academic and professional development, you will find in Professor Stucker a devoted educator and a good friend.&quot;</p>

       <p>Thanks Dan. Here are a few more tidbits about my professional career. &quot;Name-dropping&quot; perhaps, but the intent is to demonstrate that I actually &quot;do this,&quot; I don't just teach.</p>
       
       <p>I continue an active professional career that includes work  as technical engineer for artists including: John Mellencamp, The Fray, and producer/engineer  Warren Huart (Aerosmith, James Blunt, X Factor).</p>
         
	   <p>I am also an active recording engineer with credits in television, theatrical  productions, and live sound design in addition to many genres of music  recording.</p>
		
       <p>Some of the artists I have been lucky enough to have worked with include: The Fray, Beaux Arts Trio, John Mellencamp, T-Bone Burnett, Howie Day, Eddie Kramer, Over the Rhine, Tori Amos, Third Watch (NBC), PBS, Robert Mirabal, Blast!, Don Gehman, David Thoener, Superchunk, and many others. </p>
