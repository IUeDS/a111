      <p class="ipad_clear">There are two main ways to describe and measure electricity; current and voltage. Current is the movement of electrons while voltage is the force that causes the electrons to move.</p>
      
      <h2>Electron Flow</h2>
      <p>Two things are needed for electrons to flow: </p>
      <ol>
      	<li>A voltage potential: the larger the voltage, the larger the flow of electrons.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A complete circuit: a path allowing electrons to flow.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><span class="term">Current</span> is the flow of electrons in a particular direction. As you learned in section 1-1, electrons will always flow from a more negative charge to a more positive charge. Throughout this book that will be referred to as <span class="term">electron flow</span> and will be represented in drawings by &quot;<span class="term">e&#8594;</span>&quot;. </p>
      
      <h2>Conventional Current</h2>
      <p style="overflow: visible">Originally (before electrons were discovered) it was thought that current flowed from positive to negative. This is now called conventional current flow, and has the opposite direction from electron flow. Conventional current flow goes from a more positive charge to a more negative charge. <span class="term">Conventional current</span> (referred to as simply &quot;current&quot; for the rest of the book) is represented with the symbol <span class="term">I</span> (upper case I, as in “Ice”) and in this book will be presented in drawings as &quot;<span class="term">I&#8592;</span>&quot;. </p>
      <p style="overflow: visible">
        <h2>Measuring</h2>
      </p>
      <p style="overflow: visible">The unit of current flow is called the <span class="term">ampere</span> and is a numeric value based on how many electrons flow past a point in a certain amount of time. One ampere (amp for short) of current means that $ 6.25 \times 10^{18} $ electrons have moved past a point in one second.</p>
      <p>Everything for electron flow and conventional current are exactly the same, except for direction. This is because they are describing the same phenomenon, just from different perspectives.</p>
      
      <div class="aside_RightWrap mobile_center">
      	Ground will be discussed in more detail later, for now all you need to understand is that ground is 0 volts and that the schematic symbol for it is as shown in Figure 4-1.
      		<img class="image_border" src="../img/unit01/gnd.png"  alt="" style="margin: 10px auto 0px auto">
            <div class="caption">Figure 4-1</div>
      </div> <!-- end of aside_RightWrap div -->
      
      <h2>Why not pick one?</h2>
      <p>This text will use both conventional current flow and electron flow interchangeably.  The main benefit to being comfortable using both, and moving between them, will be demonstrated in later chapters when transistors are discussed. </p>
      
      <h2>Voltage</h2>
      <p>Voltage, which can be thought of as an electronic pressure, is the charge that causes this electron movement. <span class="term">Voltage</span> is represented with the symbol <span class="term">V</span>. Voltage is the difference in potential between two points. Most often we refer to a voltage with respect to ground. That means the difference in &quot;pressure&quot; between ground and that point. </p>
      <p>We can also say &quot;voltage across&quot; or &quot;voltage dropped by&quot; which means the difference in voltage between two sides of something, such as a component. </p>
      
      <h2>Voltage without Current</h2>
      <p>Another basic concept of electronics is that you can have voltage without current but you can not have current without voltage. Voltage is the force that moves electrons and causes current flow, so current flow (the movement of electrons) can not exist without voltage. It is possible, however, to have voltage without current flow. </p>

      		<div class="basicconcept_header">Second Basic Concept of Electronics</div>
      	 	<div class="basicconcept_body">You can have Voltage without Current flow, but you can NOT have Current flow without Voltage.</div>
      	</div> <!-- end of basicconcept div -->
        
      <p>Imagine a door. The force of pushing on the door is voltage and the movement of the door is current (or electron) flow. If the door is not latched (a closed circuit in elecronics) and you push on it (voltage in electronics), then the door will move (current will flow).  If you do not push on the door, then it doesn’t move (no current flow without voltage). </p>
      <p>If the door is latched, however, you can still push on the door (voltage) but the door will not move. You can have voltage without current flow. We will come back to this later, after we have built some more foundation.
